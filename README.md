# Cellular-Automaton
This is a simple 1-dimensional (1-D) cellular automaton (CA) which displays each generation of the automaton in the shell
Each automata is generated by selecting from one of the pre-determined rulesets
Every time an automata is generated, it is saved onto the text file
There is also a feature to convert from binary to decimal, and decimal to binary
